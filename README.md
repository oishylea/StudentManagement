# Student Management System

As part of a work-based learning project with YouthVenture Asia, my team and I developed a student management system that functions similarly to LinkedIn, featuring 14 modules including profile, rewards, activity, resume, feedback, registration, and dashboard. The system allows for activity registration, a dashboard for three distinct roles (master admin, client, and student), and the ability to automatically retrieve student data for registered activities. Users can also submit and analyze feedback on activities, as well as generate resumes. This system also has an automated character conversion (uppercase/lowercase) feature to help ensure stable user input.
